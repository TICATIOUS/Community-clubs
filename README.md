Community-clubs
================

This is the ZimboPYy curriculum used in its clubs. We are currently building more content for this. All the material here is open source
and we are still working on finding the best licence to use for this curriculum. We have basic python syntax and then a few applications 
of python programming including web development, mobile development, robotics, data science and also game development.
